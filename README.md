<i>Supplementary Figure 1.</i> All group parcellations. The above figure shows the k-means group-level parcellations for the 500 training set individuals. In each frame, k increases in an increment of 1 from 2 to 200 networks. The color scheme is preserved in the highest overlapping clusters from one parcellation to the next with an additional random color assigned to the newest network.
